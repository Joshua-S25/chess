**Notes of Success**
- Plan out the phases: Work on the current phase ahead of time, but also with balanced time.
- Commit to GitHub at *least* 10 times per phase. Be consistent, commit frequently.
- Prepare outlines. Map out small goals, pseudocode, and flow of data to accurately plan for structure and efficiency.

**Useful Commands to Remember**
- `git pull` - Pulls the most recent code from GitHub to IED.
- `git push` - Pushes staged changes from IED to GitHub.
- `git commit` - Saves staged changes. Adding `-m ""` Allows for a message to be added from the Terminal.
- `git add` - Stages changes of files in preparation for *commit*. Adding `.` adds all files listed under 'to be staged'.
- `git checkout` - Revisits a version of the code.
