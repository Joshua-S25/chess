**Notes of Success**
- Plan out the phases: Work on the current phase ahead of time, but also with balanced time.
- Commit to GitHub at *least* 10 times per phase. Be consistent, commit frequently.
- Prepare outlines. Map out small goals, pseudocode, and flow of data to accurately plan for structure and efficiency.
